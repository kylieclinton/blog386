## ~Introduction~
The Marvel Api provides insights into the Marvel Comic Universe and its characters. The data contains answers to several questions I found when looking at the API general information. My previous post <a href="https://kylieclinton.github.io/blog386/2023/11/10/second-post.html" target="_blank">Marvel EDA Intro</a> discussed in more detail my motivation behind the questions I developed and why I chose this dataset. To paraphrase, I grew up enjoying Marvel movies and was curious how the comics would affect movie production. I was also curious about popular characters and how popular they have been in comics over time. The questions I formed were as follows:
 - What are the trends in character popularity within the Marvel Universe, and how have these trends evolved over time?
 - What insights can be gained regarding the changing popularity with different characters and events within the Marvel Universe?

The rest of this post delves into my findings from my exploratory data analysis (EDA).
