To further my Data Science skillset and explore potential machine learning applications, I wanted to do a project that would encapsulate both. At the moment, I have pulled the data and am just beginning my EDA. To observe the progress on my EDA, check out my repository <a href = "https://github.com/kylieclinton/fda.git" targer="_blank">here</a>.

Once my EDA is complete I will write a formal blog post. Until then, enjoy the repository and anticipation for what questions will form and results will be found from the openFDA API.
