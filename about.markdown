I am a recent BYU graduate with a BS in Statistics: Data Science. I enjoy learning new skills in the statistics world. This blog is a way for me to demonstrate new skills, explore growing areas, and experiment with different datasets. From general data science to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, this blog's goal is to instruct and bring readers along in my journey as a statistician.
